# EthCrowd

An Ethereum Blockchain based crowdfunding app made using Solidity, React, Hardhat, and Web3.js

## UseCase

Decentralization is the future and this application helps to open campaigns that can be started by anyone and funded by anyone without the need of a mediator that processes the transactions. Since the transactions are written on blockchain, they are immutable and can always be referred to in case of any discrepancies.

## Features

- Email based authorization implemented using Savo Labs
- Users can create their campaigns and ask for funds in form of a custom crypto token CHLP (CrowdHelp).
- Other users can login and use their MetaMask wallet to fund the existing campaigns.
